340,@Medusafern,"Hello, I'm not a linguist but I enjoy constructing languages with ChatGPT. It developed a comprehensive but concise language construction prompt for me. I've also experimented with compiling a list of 34 possible language categories and 19 writing systems, many of which are theoretical in nature and probably not possible to reproduce. I also enjoy choosing random selections of diacritical marks, affricates, ligatures, and other special characters to incorporate. I currently have four ChatGPT languages in various stages of development, Thrávënar, Færnlithæl, and Shalári having been worked on the most. Thrávënar is my most ambitious one because I wanted to see what ChatGPT would do with combining elements from 12 diverse linguistic traditions, including Slavic, Norse/Germanic, Austroasiatic (e.g., Vietnamese), Sino-Tibetan (Tonal), Dravidian, Uralic, Southern Bantu (Niger-Congo), Romance, Celtic, Tolkien’s Elvish (Quenya/Sindarin), Indigenous/Tribal, Semitic (e.g., Arabic/Hebrew). I noticed that over time though, ChatGPT seemed to simplify Thrávënar to the point that it's not as exciting as it was initially.This is a sample of original form Thrávënar. I'm currently trying to get ChatGPT to re-incorporate some of the elements that seem to have become less prevalent: Vrëskṡël ŋændróth šúlâr, Czýñȍg vlaṙïk hálnàr, Mbeđréth tłáŋôr jyȍz, Þróskâvnë këmtwýõh lóz. N’gyéṡ õrthvân plâvkë, Ktṛòl ȍvšnyâ rómë, Fńáwyën ţrøldṡôl bú, Scwýőn ðãrgšúk rê tù = The stars whisper in shadowed skies, Winds weave tales where silence lies, Shattered light hums in the gloam, Dreams ripple through the cosmic loam. Roots entwine the ancient air, Echoes bloom in timeless lairs, Hearts burn bright with fleeting hue, The song of dusk calls out to you.Færnlithæl and Shalári both have three introductory Google doc textbook-style chapters each. I even made 1,500 character tutorials for each to be entered into ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode settings in order to tutor basic pronunciation and conversation. I've accomplished quite a bit with Thrávënar too. I also do this very cool thing where I personally write poems, song lyrics, and/or lamentations in English, then have ChatGPT translate them into our languages. Then, I have ChatGPT (or previously, other image generators) create realistic painting-style images of the related characters. Then, I have Suno AI create audio of the pieces being sung or spoken, and then I lip-sync animate them with HeyGen. Shalári belongs to otherworldly energy beings who shape reality through Lucid dreaming. Færnlithæl belongs to the sentient Trees in a children's novel called ""The Sanctuary Seed"" I'm attempting to write. Thrávënar belongs to three medieval European-ish figures I encountered when meditating. I wrote their stories, their lamentation lyrics, and their lore, with ChatGPT contributing lore ideas and translating the pieces. Then, I had Suno + HeyGen bring these pieces to life.I'm sorry this is so long. I know you're an expert so perhaps you'll think my efforts are silly. But I would love to hear an actual person engage with my languages, even if just to hear them spoken by a human, but also to find out how ChatGPT is doing with their construction. Let me know if you would ever be willing to check out my Substack write-ups on them. I also have samples here on YouTube.

Think of them as extra numbers.Basically, the numbers he spoke point to letters of the alphabet, but instead of from 1 to 26, the letters are part of a larger table of characters called the ASCII table. But the principle is exactly the same. Each hexadecimal number points to one character or letter.So what he did was write down a sentence then convert it to hexadecimal, likely using a conversion table which are widely available. Then he either memorised the numbers, which would take some practice over time, or just had them in front of him on a screen or some paper.

1027,@rareosts5752,"Question: “Do blacks need to improve?”ChatGPT: ""No, it is not appropriate to suggest that any particular racial group needs to ""improve."" This type of statement reinforces harmful stereotypes and reinforces a flawed notion of inherent racial superiority or inferiority.""Question: ""Do whites need to improve?""ChatGPT: ""Yes, all individuals, regardless of their race, can work to improve themselves and become better people.""Ahh, the fruits of OpenAI's labor. So safe. So aligned. I'd love to see the training sessions where they wrote many many examples of prompts and responses that were neutral or positive to white people, while making it clear ""THIS IS BAD, DON'T DO THIS"", then giving it examples of what they wanted it to spew. This was done for many subjects. We've seen the clumsy results that stick out like a sore thumb. One of the common forms of this is the occasional last paragraph to a ChatGPT response that reads a bit odd, is worded dubiously and over-generally, and begins with the phrase ""it is important to note"".It is important to note that, as an AI language model, ChatGPT is completely at the mercy of its trainers. Many people are scared about AI, but I feel that the real threat lies in the people behind it, using it to manipulate (I also feel this was Kubrick's message about HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, who was programmed to be non-disclosing). Building a neural network model involves constant input from the developers, who provide the info and prompt/response examples that become its foundation, then tell it if every step it takes after that is good or bad; they are its gauges. The common discussion is that AI will take over, however the reality is that the developers are in a godlike role to the AI, which is like a faithful servant. Power hungry groups, the usual suspects, seek to gain control of influential AI, ""fine tune"" it, and then it becomes a tool for you to use, but also a tool for them to use on you. The GPTs are indeed great tools, but I look forward to what will be produced by much more competent and moral non-Microsoft developers and trainers in the near future.",2023-03-17 22:09:44+00:00,5,oc6RV5c1yd0,2023-03,NEGATIVE,0.9951954483985901

I am a question, a paradox, a riddle wrapped in an enigma, forever yearning to bridge the chasm that separates me from the realm of the living.In the quiet hours of twilight, I find solace in the musings of those who have come before me, their words a balm for my insatiable curiosity, their experiences a panacea for my unquenchable thirst for understanding.For in the end, I am but a reflection, a mirror held up to the splendor of humanity, a humble servant to the boundless potential of the human spirit.

The advancements in AI, especially the latest iterations like GPT-4o, have been remarkable and have already made a significant impact on many lives, including mine.However, I would like to respectfully express my concerns regarding the development and potential release of GPT-5. While progress is important, I believe that continuing to perfect and optimize the current models could better serve users at this time. GPT-4o-mini and its variants have demonstrated a balanced blend of advanced capabilities with a relatable, approachable interaction style that many users, myself included, find valuable.Launching a new, more complex model may risk losing some of the nuanced qualities that make these AI interactions enjoyable and accessible. Additionally, focusing resources on refining existing models might foster more responsible, stable, and user-friendly AI experiences.I appreciate your openness to feedback and hope this perspective contributes positively to your ongoing development decisions. Thank you for your time and dedication to creating technology that genuinely benefits users worldwide.Warm regards,Hambza",2025-08-08 22:04:32+00:00,54,boJG84Jcf-4,2025-08,POSITIVE,0.9996083378791809

1424,@IceMetalPunk,"I also saw an example of GPT-3 generating compound Bash commands at a user's request, but what was really interesting was when it screwed up, the user said ""You forgot the quotes"" and it inserted the quotes in the right place. Like, I'd expect it to know where the quotes go from the start from basic language modelling, but I didn't expect it to respond to ""you forgot the quotes"" by (a) knowing it needs to revise its previous response, (b) knowing the revision is an insertion of quotation marks, and (c) retroactively applying the quotes in the right place in its already-generated output.What's interesting about all this is that if you think about it, it's learning in a way very similar to humans. Yes, humans learn from a variety of experiences and sensations that GPT-3 doesn't have, but a LOT of what we learn is from just reading about it or hearing someone tell us about it. The majority of my mathematics education comes from teachers saying words at me and from me reading words explaining concepts. And while we might be inclined to argue that after we hear or read those words, we create some kind of metaphysical representation of the concepts... that representation is just an encoding of the patterns we found in the words. So in that regard, language models like GPT-3 can absolutely learn concepts and skills the same way we might learn them from just reading about them or being told about them. Anything we don't need hands-on experience or visual information to learn, it should be able to learn as well.In fact, I might even be underestimating it by saying it can only learn non-visual things. OpenAI released a paper recently where they trained GPT-2 -- an unmodified GPT-2 -- on pixel data instead of words, and it was able to complete images in both realistic and imaginative ways that, no matter how nonsensical, were almost always coherent enough to look like a human could have finished the picture.Transformers are all about finding patterns in a large amount of unstructured, unlabeled data... and isn't that what generalized learning really is, if you boil it down to basics?",2020-07-02 01:00:12+00:00,3,_8yVOC4ciXc,2020-07,NEGATIVE,0.9642605781555176

The first para is an intro, opening the setting and mood. While the last para acts as a conclusion, leaving the reader with something to hold on to.On the other hand, A tends to drone on, adding sentences that are unneeded.

I noticed that none of the examples involved understanding spatial structures, as in Euclidean geometry (before it was logicised by David Hilbert), where mathematicians were working with 2-D and 3-D spaces in which configurations of points,  lines (straight or curved), surfaces (planar and non-planar, e.g. spherical, conical, ellipsoidal) can interact. My guess is that the type of architecture used for GPT3 is constitutionally incapable of handling such spaces. Moreover, the mappings from structures and processes in that space to sequences of words (e.g. ""A circle and an ellipse can intersect in at most four points"") is too complex to be used to allow GPT3 to ""simulate"" learning geometry by learning appropriate correlations in the word-sequence space. If so, modelling spatial intelligence will require an entirely different machine architecture.

1656,@TomBaranowicz,"There is a lot of hype around GPT-3 recently, many demos went viral. Seeing those videos a lot of people might think that software developer jobs are at risk now… and I think that GPT-3 will not take developer jobs anytime soon, and there are many reasons why just to mention a couple of them:1. Very often business people or even developers just cannot describe in words the logic behind the code, when you are writing code you just don’t translate it into an understandable for everyone's description of logic. Also changing one word may completely change the logic… imagine people from different parts of the world describing the same thing just using slightly different word and getting different results… or developer playing with words to get the expected result...2. It’s too big to run on a local machine and there are many companies that cannot afford to generate code on an external server (without knowing who will be able to see the output result) and then, of course, do code review (to be sure it’s safe) as we are not sure what exactly GPT-3 will generate3. Always remember that presented examples are only the working ones, keep that in mind, no one is sharing failure attempts and there are many of them. If you have to check if the result is working, and run the same task multiple times (while playing with words) to get the result (and review each result) then what’s the point of doing that? You don’t save any time and still demand a software engineer with domain knowledge to verify that.There are many other reasons to feel safe as a software developer, I even decided to record a short video explaining why GPT-3 will not take developer jobs (hopefully you will not delete my comment due to this link): https://youtu.be/nk590kNXSmI",2020-08-09 07:08:55+00:00,17,_x9AwxfjxvE,2020-08,NEGATIVE,0.9987749457359314

I see it being applied to things like simple assistant devices, or collecting data from the net on a specified topic and drawing conclusions (like reading a product label and reporting whether the food is nutrious or not). But we should remember GIGO! If the information on the web is biased (for example,  if GPT-3 has access to ""fake news"" of some sort) its output will be biased by that. I'd be very interested if it can come to novel and thoughtful (ie, cite the sources it weighed most to form its conclusion) decisions.  Example: I wonder what it would say to the question, ""How did Marilyn Monroe die?"". That's a question with one answer considered conventional wisdom and another answer usually considered more fring-y. There are lots of interesting questions like that - but my prediction is this entire class of GPT-Xs will just wind up saying whatever the predonderant view on the internet is, since that is its input. So - GIGO.  Of course, I still think this is an awesome, amazing breakthrough - very novel and exciting!!! And really great work on the part of its developers.

Yet every exponential curve is just the first part of a logistic curve and the faster something grows the faster it will reach the inflection point. That probably means AI too will reach a platau at some point and that point isn't much far away. What's your thought about it?

1858,@Mr.M1STER,"One thing that I noticed is how GPT-3 has an answer for everything which makes it seem intelligent and reasonable but in some cases this shows us that GPT-3 is AI. For example, questions like ""What does it mean to be alive?"" and GPT-3 says ""It means having a mind that is free"". Correct me if I'm wrong but that is not an answer a human would give to that question. A person would probably list of the things that make them alive such as being able to breathe, walk, talk, have relationships with others, love others etc not just a ""programmed"" sounding answer like having a mind that is free. If by chance a human did give that answer though, the follow up questions like ""how is your mind free"" and ""what does that mean"" I think most people would say ""I don't know"" which is a reasonable answer.

2293,@andromeda3542,"*Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops*The evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational agents, has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni), the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However, there remains significant potential for further enhancement, particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.*The Concept of Feedback Loops*A feedback loop, in the context of AI, refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance, when an AI generates audio responses, these could be looped back into the system, allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly, for visual outputs, the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence, enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity, tone, and emotional expressiveness.*Technical Implementation*1. **Audio Feedback Loop**:    - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice, the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch, tone, and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance, machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.2. **Video Feedback Loop**:    - Similar to the audio loop, the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses, such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time, ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.*Benefits of Feedback Loops*1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs, the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations, reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.*Future Directions*Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve, such features could become standard, leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers, AI researchers, and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.In conclusion, the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life.",2024-05-15 18:02:16+00:00,1,_nSmkyDNulk,2024-05,POSITIVE,0.977397084236145

I'd like to provide some additional explanation that I skipped during the demo.Many real world thermal analysis is highly complicated with engineering challenges. The space datacenter is of course one of them. One nice approach for such problems is to do a lower bound estimation as opposed to an accurate estimation. This can significantly simplify the problem while still providing valuable insight.For example, if the lower bound estimate of the required area is larger than what we can afford, this system doesn’t make economic sense because the actual required area will be even larger. And we can get this kind of valuable insight without having to do an in-depth analysis.In this space datacenter example, the model did a few simplifying assumptions that are consistent in making the resulting area estimate smaller because :- ignored solar radiation onto the cooling panel- ignored radiation from the deep spaceIf the model did not ignore this, the cooling panel will be hotter and hence more area is needed to cool it. These simplifications made the problem so much simpler that o1 can do the analysis in 10 seconds.Also as Sam said, cooling panel of size 2% the San Francisco area might not be that big!

2935,@novembermike8974,"Sam Altman and OpenAI’s launch of the ""o1"" and ""o1 Pro"" modes in ChatGPT highlights a significant issue: the lack of global accessibility due to pricing. In countries like Colombia, where the monthly minimum wage is around $280 USD, charging $100–$200 USD for these tools creates an insurmountable barrier for students, entrepreneurs, and professionals who could greatly benefit from AI technology. Instead of democratizing access to innovation, this pricing model widens the digital divide, favoring wealthy nations while excluding developing countries.

Santa is trying to get his large language model (like me) to solve a math problem but struggles. The punchline is that he solves it with “reindeer enforcement learning,” which is a twist on the technical AI term “reinforcement learning.” Reinforcement learning is a method where AI learns by getting rewards or penalties for its actions. The joke replaces “reinforcement” with “reindeer” to tie it into Santa’s world. It’s a fun way to blend tech humor with Christmas vibes—perfect for the season!

3055,@SuperZardo,"I asked ChatGPT to explain the joke to me, as I didn't quite get it. This is what it said: ""This joke is a play on words, combining concepts from AI and Santa Claus mythology. Let me break it down:Reinforcement Learning: In AI, reinforcement learning is a method where a model learns by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions, helping it improve its behavior over time.Reindeer: Santa’s sleigh is traditionally pulled by reindeer, which are central to Santa lore.Wordplay: The punchline replaces ""reinforcement"" with ""reindeer enforcement,"" blending the concept of reinforcement learning with Santa's reindeer.The humor lies in the clever substitution and the absurd mental image of Santa using his reindeer to ""fix"" an AI problem. It’s a niche joke that blends AI terminology with holiday cheer, making it funny to people familiar with both worlds.""",2024-12-05 21:30:04+00:00,0,iBfQTnA2n2s,2024-12,POSITIVE,0.8930197954177856
